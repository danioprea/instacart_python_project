# instacart_python_project

## Objective

This project focused on Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I used Python to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Data

We used and analyzed the following datasets:
- Orders
- Products
- Customers
- Departments

## Tools

For this project, the following Python libraries were used:
- pandas - for data analysis
- seaborn - for visualization
